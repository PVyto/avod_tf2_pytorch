Thesis Code: Avod_tensorflow2_pytorch
=================================

This code, developed as part of my thesis which was completed in November 2021. It is based on the [**Joint 3D Proposal Generation and Object Detection from View Aggregation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02294) paper and it's original implementation which can be found here: [**Aggregate View Object Detection**](https://github.com/kujason/avod#aggregate-view-object-detection).  The primary objective was to replicate the results of the referenced paper and make slight architectural modifications to evaluate performance.
